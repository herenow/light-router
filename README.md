light-router
============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/herenow/light-router.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/herenow/light-router)

A light node.js http request router, it doesn't use regexp for matching, thus doesn't support complex patterns. It aims for performance and a more implicit route declaration model.

* Note that this router is in an alpha version, I don't guarantee forward compatibility with future versions.


**Under development**

##TODO
- Add cache layer
- Think about adding regexp
- Add all http methods to routing table
