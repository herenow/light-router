light-router
============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/herenow/light-router.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/herenow/light-router)

A router for node.js performance junkies :)

This router is still under development, and any suggestion would be aprreciated. I'm still figuring out features that should be implemented.

Note that this router is not as flexible as other routers, it is mostly useful for building simple APIs that don't depend on complex middleware schemes.


Why?
---------
Most node.js http routers I tested had a really high overhead for a router, and in some cases it became the bottleneck of really simple API's I wrote. [See benchmarks below](#benchmarks)


Install
---------
```
npm install light-router
```

Sample usage
---------
```javascript
var http   = require('http')
var router = require('light-router')

//Start an http server and pass all requests to light-router
http.createServer(router).listen(80)

//Set a route and its handler fnc
router.get('/v1/hello/:user', function(req, res) {
  res.end('Hello, ' + req.params.user)
})
```

* Note that this module has a singleton design pattern.
* The only thing that this router does to the `req` object is attach params.


Features
----------
* **Hashtable based** routing
* **Cache layer** for faster delivery
* **Cache control** for setting cache max size and disabling cache for some routes
* **RegExp** for parameter testing
* **404**, set custom not found handler


Methods overview
------------
I recommend reading everything if you want to get a general overview of the architecture of this router.

####router[method]\(route, handler)
The following http methods are avaialble: **get, post, put, head, delete, options, trace, connect**
Writing routes follows the express/rails model. You can write **:param** to extract params from the request url and **:param(regexp)** to create rules for the parameter. **Be careful with the order you declare your routes!**

```javascript
//Will only match integer userIDs
router.get('/v1/user/:id([0-9])', function(req, res) {
  res.end('Your numeric userID is: ' + req.params.id)
})

//Will only match all other ids that werent numerical only
router.get('/v1/user/:id)', function(req, res) {
  res.end('Your userID is: ' + req.params.id)
})
```


####route.cache(boolean)
Control the caching for this route, you should disable caching for highly dynamic routes.

```javascript
router.put('/v1/user/:id', handler).cache(false)
```


####router.notFound(handler)
Set a custom handler for the 404 not found.

```javascript
router.notFound(function(req, res) {
  res.statusCode = 404
  res.end('Sorry this page was not found :(')
})
```


####router.cache.maxSize(boolean)
Set the max cache table size of each http method, by default its set to **10,000**. Each http method has its own cache table, so the total cached routes you can have is: **maxSize * http_verbs**

```javascript
router.cache.maxSize(10)
```

####router.cache.clear()
Clear the cache table, maybe it could be useful :)

```javascript
router.cache.clear()
```

Conclusion
-----------
Light-router is in an alpha version and it seems to be working fine, it seems to be fast even with no caching layer, and maybe I'll remove the caching layer in a later version.

Notes:
* Read the file `lib/router.js` to get a better understanding of how requests are routed to their handlers
* Complex RegExp are slow, if you can dont use them to much :)
